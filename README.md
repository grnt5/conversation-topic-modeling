# Conversation Topic Modeling

**Project Background**

This is a textual analysis project I made for a term project for 36-468 Special Topics: Text Analysis at CMU in Fall 2023 (Grade: 98%). Using the CANDOR spoken American English corpus, the purpose of the analysis was to identify similarities and differences in prevalent discussion topics between people of the same or different demographic groups and infer explanations of such through the lens of American culture. Besides omitted file paths and additional comments, all scripts and writing in the report remain unchanged since the project's submission.

Since access to the data I use is by request, such is not available in this repository. You can find the website and Google Form for requests for the CANDOR corpus here:
